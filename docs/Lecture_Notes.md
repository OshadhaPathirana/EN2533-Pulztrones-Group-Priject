# Lecture 3: Mechanical Design
Come with Idea, Build it and then Test it.

## Robot Platform

### Material Selection
- Wood - best for initial prototype 
- Acrylic - Acrylic Plexiglass  
        - Laser cutting Machine available at the department
- PVC - Polyvinyl Chloride
- Aluminum 
- Composite - Carbon Fiber, Fiberglass, Kevlar

### Properties of good platform
- Plexiglass with aluminum framework for strength
- easy to add and remove parts
        
        Use one size of PCBs you can drill Holes ahead off tomes and able to stack PCBs,
        Use Spacers to stack PCBs
- Balance
        
        Weight of the robot be mostly within support polygon.
        CoG Should be Low As possible.

- Practical Size
        
        Enough space for all the components
        Small enough to fit in the competition area
            Adhere to the Size constraints of the competition

### Wheels

#### Wheel Type
- Pneumatic
- semi-pneumatic
- Solid

#### Shapes
- Rounded - Good for steering
- Balloon
- Flat

#### Linear velocity
- V = Ï‰ * r
- We don't want robot to have too much velocity
- robot will drive off the course if it is too fast


#### Number of Wheels
- at least 3 wheels for passive stability
- Powered wheels should be at least 2
- Passive wheels should be at least 1 (caster wheel)


## Platform Maneuverability
### Turning
- Differential Drive - 2 independently driven wheels
- Ackerman Steering - 4 wheels, 2 driven, 2 steered
- Skid Steering - 4 wheels, 2 driven, 2 steered


## Mechanisms

### Gears
- Spur Gears - Excellent at moderate speeds, Noisy at high speeds
- Bevel Gears - Used to change direction of rotation
- Helical Gears - Teeth are not parallel to the axis of rotation, Good for high speed 
- Worm Gears - Used to reduce speed and increase torque, Screw is meshed with spur gear. Doesn't Work in other direction
- Planetary Gears - Used to reduce speed and increase torque, Used in gearboxes, Provides High power density

### Intermittent Mechanisms

### Belt and Chain Drives
- Forward motion belt

### Crank Mechanism
- Converts rotary motion to linear motion
e.g. Piston in an engine
### Bell Crank Mechanism
### Cam Mechanism
- Converts rotary motion to simple or complex reciprocating linear motion
### Quick Return Mechanism
- Converts rotary motion to reciprocating linear motion with different speeds in forward and backward directions
eg: Shooting Mechanism, Pressing Mechanism, Cutting Mechanism, etc.
### Ratchet Mechanism
- Hold the motion

### Couplings and Bearings
### springs and dampers

### Gripper
Find the best way to grip the object.
